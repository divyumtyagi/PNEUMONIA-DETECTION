PNEUMONIA DETECTION USING CHEST X-RAYS THROUGH (CNNs)
The motive of this project is to provide a preliminary insight into whether a person has Pneumonia or not. So that any individual who has been under influence can get the required medical attention/care. Based of deep learning neural network ,CNNs.
This is a demonstration basis model with which we have achieved an Accuracy of 88% with the ratio of training and testing data (70-30%).
Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung primarily affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli. Symptoms typically include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing

Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.

Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems
SYMPTOMS: 
Chest pain when you breathe or cough
Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older)
Cough, which may produce phlegm
Fatigue
Fever, sweating and shaking chills
Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems)
Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea
Shortness of breath

The current system of Pneumonia detection is fully manual, requiring a visit to a Radiologist to fully interpret the X-ray images.
While it is advised to leave final diagnosis to a medical expert, the process is often expensive and/or time-consuming which makes it difficult for low-income patients.
The objective of this project is to provide a preliminary insight into whether a person has Pneumonia or not.
This is to provide an early-warning so that the patient can make financial arrangements for further treatment.

Artificial intelligence for the detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT using multinational datasets
In total, 2724 scans from 2617 patients were used in this study. Of these, 1387 scans from 1280 patients were utilized for algorithm development, and 1337 patients were utilized for algorithm testing and evaluation. Prevalence of COVID-19 patients in the testing set was 24.4% (326/1337). For testing evaluation, one scan series per patient was considered. Two classification models were developed for further evaluation. Training converged at highest validation accuracy of 92.4% and 91.7% for hybrid 3D and full 3D classification models, respectively, for the task determining COVID-19 vs. other conditions. The highest test set accuracy was observed with the 3D classification model (90.8%).
Our project aims to provide a webpage for the user to enter their x-ray images and then perform its predictions on the server.
The calculations are done server-side to reduce hardware requirement at the user end.
A convolutional neural network, or CNN, is a deep learning neural network sketched for processing structured arrays of data such as portrayals.

CNN are very satisfactory at picking up on design in the input image, such as lines, gradients, circles, or even eyes and faces.

This characteristic that makes convolutional neural network so robust for computer vision.

The strength of a convolutional neural network comes from a particular kind of layer called the convolutional layer.

CNN contains many convolutional layers assembled on top of each other, each one competent of recognizing more sophisticated shapes.
